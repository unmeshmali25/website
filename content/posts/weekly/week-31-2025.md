## Week 31, 2025

### Work <span style="float: right;">{{< rating 2 >}}</span>
<!-- {{< collapse maxHeight="100" >}}
{{< /collapse >}} -->
Work was slow. Gave me a lot of time to organize and attend business meetings. Spent some time in eliminating a models re-training bottleneck. Now our model retrainings are fast and devoid of any technical dependencies. 


### Projects <span style="float: right;">{{< rating 1 >}}</span>
####  <span style="color: teal">Reinforcement Learning</span>
No work done on my RL project this week. 


### Books <span style="float: right;">{{< rating 2 >}}</span>
####  <span style="color: teal">The Forever War - Joe Haldeman</span>
I spent about a couple hours reading about 50 pages of this book. Nothing exciting has happened yet. The first battle ended and now they are being chased by the aliens through the Collapsar (or a interstellar travel space kind of like a wormhole). Looking forward to the rest of the book. 

### Fitness <span style="float: right;">{{< rating 5 >}}</span>
This was a perfect week for fitness. 
- I fasted once (24-hour water-only fast)
- I went to the gym 4 times. 
- I went hiking once
- I played Cricket (after a break of 2-years).
