# Week 18, 2021

May 16, 2021
Categories: Weekly Notes
Came down with the flu this week. Couldn’t get a lot of ## work/reading/exercise
done. I don’t know why I am even writing this blog with nothing to show for
the week.
Be-dili kya yunhi din guzar jayenge
Sirf zinda rahe hum to mar jaenge
Jaun Eliya
Apart from the unproductive week, I have two major news to share. I have been
selected for the Research intern position at Council on Energy, Environment,
and Water which is going to be remote. And I am starting my Machine Learning
Bootcamp at FourthBrain next week. I fear that I might have taken up too much
## work but I am more afraid to let go of these amazing opportunities coming my
way. Also, I believe that each of these tasks will enhance the other and I
might even succeed with flying colors. I’ll be going into ## work full time
starting May 15th, 2021, so I don’t have to worry about these side ## projects
affecting my full-time job. I can leave ## work at ## work.
I am also taking inspiration from Elon Musk. If he can run 2 multi-billion
dollar companies simultaneously, I should be able to handle couple ## projects.
I just hope that I give my best to each of these tasks for the next 3-4
months. I am sure meditation is going to help me in a big way. I will try to
make it a habit to meditate everyday to help me get through the busy weeks
ahead.
