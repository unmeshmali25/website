My goal is to become capable of reading research papers and implementing them to solve business/engineering problems using RL. I used the "Study and Learn" mode in ChatGPT to generate the below plan. It seems a decent structure to get me started. I am estimating 5-10 hours per week of work. However, I will push myself to get this done faster and complete it by end of 2025.
