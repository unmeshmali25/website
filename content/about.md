**Welcome to my corner of the internet. Here I mostly write about this and that.**

I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer (or internally referred to Senior Data Scientist) at CVS Health. Specifically I work in the Offer Engine team of CVS Retail to make customers shop more and often by giving right offers to the right customers. The work sounds simple but at the scale of many millions of customers and working in a Fortune 500 company with its rate of change limitations, the personal, technical challenges and nuances quickly add up.
