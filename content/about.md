**Welcome to my corner of the internet. Join me in surviving through the danger and excitement of a not-too-distant future of AGI as a tech worker.**

I am currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at CVS Health. Specifically, I work in the Offer Engine team of CVS Retail, where my focus is on making customers shop more and often by providing the right offers to the right customers. My job involves part Data Science, part Machine Learning, part MLOPs, and all heart.
