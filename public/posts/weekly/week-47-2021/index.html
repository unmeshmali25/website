I hate writing, I love having written – Dorothy Parker
I am writing a weekly blog after a very long break. 14 weeks long. Many
things happened and this blog would be paraphrasing the last 14 weeks. 
Work 
Work has been moving slow. Since September, we have had 2 software releases
of our product. I have been involved in developing algorithms for some of the
features. One example is an algorithm for operating a group of battery
systems (with or without solar) as a virtual power plant through openADR. I
can’t be transparent about the rest of the ## work on this blog. My work mostly
involves identifying and fixing bugs using data, communicating results with
clients or answering their questions and concerns with eloquent
visualizations. " />

<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #d73a49">I hate writing, I love having written – Dorothy Parker</span></p></blockquote>
<p>I am writing a weekly blog after a very long break. 14 weeks long. Many
things happened and this blog would be paraphrasing the last 14 weeks. </p>
<h3 id="work">Work </h3>
<p>Work has been moving slow. Since September, we have had 2 software releases
of our product. I have been involved in developing algorithms for some of the
features. One example is an algorithm for operating a group of battery
systems (with or without solar) as a virtual power plant through openADR. I
can’t be transparent about the rest of the ## work on this blog. My work mostly
involves identifying and fixing bugs using data, communicating results with
clients or answering their questions and concerns with eloquent
visualizations. </p>
<h3 id="side-hustles">Side Hustles </h3>
<h4 id="fourthbrain-ml-bootcamp"><span style="color: teal">FourthBrain ML Bootcamp</span></h4>
<p>I graduated from the Machine Learning Bootcamp at FourthBrain. Me and Tiziano
got awarded the best capstone project award (we developed and deployed a web
app for the use of the fraud investigations team at Ibotta to identify and
bar fraudulent accounts from their app). The bootcamp covered everything
under the umbrella of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Thanks to
it, I now have a clear insight on the technical feasibility of machine
learning models and where we cannot stretch ML models too far. From my
experience so far in the energy industry, the only area I believe
sophisticated ML can provide a good value proposition is in energy trading.
For the majority of the applications that drive value, a simple arithmetic
formula can do the job and any subsequently complicated ML models are past
the point of diminishing returns. Even outside the energy industry, it’s not
as good as it seems. Most of the financial industry uses very basic ML like
linear regression which is nothing but y = mx + c. 
The places where ML and AI really practically shine today have no positive
impact on humankind according to me. To give you an example, Facebook (now
Meta) uses ML for attention harvesting to sell more ads. Google does the
same. These companies have taken this technology too far. Fire was a great
technology when invented. You can use fire either to cook your food or burn
down your house. ML and AI applications are approaching the burning down
phase. </p>
<h4 id="ceew-engineering"><span style="color: teal">CEEW Engineering</span></h4>
<p>My other side hustle with CEEW didn’t progress fast in the past 3 months. We
completed the Bus Shelter Assessment web app and presented it in the
competition. The organization was placed 5th nationally. The person who I was
reporting to is leaving CEEW soon and hence we haven’t been able to start a
new project. I am staying put for now. If any interesting project comes up,
I’ll resume working there. If not, I’ll look to volunteer or intern with
another Indian company. My goal is to spend 2-6 hours a week growing my
professional network in India and hopefully make a good name for myself while
helping companies achieve what they want. “Doing well by doing good” </p>
<h3 id="books">Books </h3>
<p>These past 14 weeks were great for reading. I finished the following books</p>
<h4 id="ghost-in-the-wires-my-adventures-as-the-worlds-most-wanted-hacker--kevin-mitnick"><span style="color: teal">Ghost in the Wires: My Adventures as the World’s Most Wanted Hacker | Kevin Mitnick</span></h4>
<h4 id="internet-of-money--andreas-antolopous"><span style="color: teal">Internet of Money | Andreas Antolopous</span></h4>
<h4 id="the-psychology-of-money--morgan-housel"><span style="color: teal">The psychology of Money | Morgan Housel</span></h4>
<h4 id="the-innovators-hypothesis--how-cheap-experiments-are-worth-more-than-good-ideas--michael-shrage"><span style="color: teal">The Innovator’s Hypothesis- How cheap experiments are worth more than good ideas | Michael Shrage</span></h4>
<h4 id="benjamin-franklin--walter-isaacson"><span style="color: teal">Benjamin Franklin | Walter Isaacson </span></h4>
<p>I am currently reading the biography of Benjamin Franklin written by Walter
Isaacson. I am 10% in and thoroughly enjoying the book. I hope some of his
characteristics rub off on me and help me rise above myself. </p>
<h3 id="fitness">Fitness</h3>
<p>My focus on exercising was dwindling until this month. Thanks to my apple
watch, I have been recording each of my workouts. I looked at the data and
realized I am falling behind in all aspects – Cycling, Strength training,
Yoga. That accountability gave me some motivation and I have been able to
pick up exercising – mostly cycling.</p>
<p>This week was Thanksgiving break. Me and
2 other friends took advantage of the holidays and biked over 50 miles on the
mountains in the North bay. We started from my place and came back from the
Pantol car park which is just 2 miles short of the peak of Mt. Tamalpais. I
was supremely exhausted but I had 2 days to recover from it. That bike ride
gave a boost of self confidence to get over the laziness mentality. I hope
only sky’s the limit for fitness for the months to follow. </p>
