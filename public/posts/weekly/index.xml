      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;week-31-2025&#34;&gt;Week 31, 2025&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;work&#34;&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was an interesting week at CVS Health. We had a team offsite on Monday and Tuesday. I was part of the planning committee. Since most of my team is spread-out all over the USA and remote, it was nice to meet everyone in person for a change.&#xA;We also retrained a few XGBoost Models which will run in production on a test cell next week. Unfortunately, I cannot talk a lot about the specifics of the work I do in interest of confidentiality. Having said that, I plan on writing essays on the work I have done with ML and MLOps in the retail space. I have learned a lot and it would be nice to write it down and share with others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
