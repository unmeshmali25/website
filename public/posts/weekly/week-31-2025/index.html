Work
This was an interesting week at CVS Health. We had a team offsite on Monday and Tuesday. I was part of the planning committee. Since most of my team is spread-out all over the USA and remote, it was nice to meet everyone in person for a change.
We also retrained a few XGBoost Models which will run in production on a test cell next week. Unfortunately, I cannot talk a lot about the specifics of the work I do in interest of confidentiality. Having said that, I plan on writing essays on the work I have done with ML and MLOps in the retail space. I have learned a lot and it would be nice to write it down and share with others." />

<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>This was an interesting week at CVS Health. We had a team offsite on Monday and Tuesday. I was part of the planning committee. Since most of my team is spread-out all over the USA and remote, it was nice to meet everyone in person for a change.
We also retrained a few XGBoost Models which will run in production on a test cell next week. Unfortunately, I cannot talk a lot about the specifics of the work I do in interest of confidentiality. Having said that, I plan on writing essays on the work I have done with ML and MLOps in the retail space. I have learned a lot and it would be nice to write it down and share with others.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<h4 id="reinforcement-learning"><span style="color: maroon">Reinforcement Learning</span></h4>
<p>I started learning RL. My initial plan was to sign up for an online certification but later decided against it. I had disappointing experience with SimpliLearn&rsquo;s Cloud Computing bootcamp and now I am not ready to jump into another (expensive) paid bootcamp.
This time I am going to take a different approach. I am going to follow Andrej Karpathy&rsquo;s advice - find a problem statement/project to work on and learn the skills &ldquo;on-demand&rdquo; as you solve the problem statement.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the LLMs, I got my first problem statement -
The question: <em>“For each customer, this week, should I send nothing or one of the 5 offers, and via which channel, so that long-run profit is maximised without breaching the weekly budget?”</em> This is in alignment with my day-to-day work at CVS.</p>
<p>I asked AI to get me a simple working prototype model and I was able to train an agent on a custom environment. That was pretty cool. However, I did not understand half of what I did and hence I switched over to watching hands-on videos of people coding RL agents to play games. That helped strenghten my intuition further. I tried to watch David Silver&rsquo;s RL lectures on YouTube but those were too technical for this week. Reading, watching, and understanding the math takes a lot of mental bandwidth. As I gather momentum with this project, my mind will be better prepared to dive in the theory of it all.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<h4 id="the-forever-war---joe-haldeman"><span style="color: maroon">The Forever War - Joe Haldeman</span></h4>
<p>I started reading this Sci-fi book a couple weeks ago. I haven&rsquo;t made much progress with this book. It would be nice to read one book a week but that&rsquo;s a tall challenge given my commitments. The book however has been interesting so far. The protagonist has been sent to a far off planet to train for battle with the alien species there. They just engaged in their first battle. I love the idea of a suit that monitors and records all your vitals in real-time (just like the ironman suit) and it also helps to adapt to any environment. I think the suits in the book are powered by fuel cells - I am not sure what type of fuel it runs on yet.</p>
<h3 id="fitness">Fitness</h3>
<p>I only logged in 2 workouts this week - one a bike ride to a park nearby and then 25 minutes in the gym this morning. I need to do better.
I faster 24 hours once this week. I need to double this as well.</p>
